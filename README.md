## xmm-client
### XMM models decoders for the browser

This library is intended to be used with the
[original XMM library](https://github.com/julesfrancoise/xmm), or its node wrapper
[xmm-node](https://github.com/Ircam-RnD/xmm-node), which take care of organizing phrases
into training sets and use them for training statistical models.

It contains 3 classes :
- PhraseMaker, which eases the creation of XMM-compatible phrases
(e.g. time series recordings of dimension n), that can then be passed to XMM.
- GmmDecoder, which takes a GMM model generated by XMM and outputs
some estimation results when it's fed with an input vector
- HhmmDecoder, which does the same with a Hierarchical HMM model generated by XMM.

#### installation :
`npm install Ircam-RnD/xmm-client [--save]`

#### note :
xmm-client is a work in progress, use at your own risk.
